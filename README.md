image dithering using opencv python 


in this program i used Floyd-Steinberg METHOD and Stucki method for dithering the image
Floyd-Steinberg METHOD is very basic one . and very easy to understand
but i'm unable to get expected result .
Stucki method works well for me

my system specifications 
os : ubuntu 14.04 LTS  , 64 bit
opencv version : 3.2.0
python : 2.7.6
